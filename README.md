What you will need to run this code will be explained below:

- understanding of Java 6 and up (duh, lol)
- Have the Edge Browser up to date, or if the Program doesnt run, please update the msedgedriver.exe in the resources folder by downloading it from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
- you can run this preferably on IntelliJ IDEA
- When you first download and open it, dont forget to reload all the Maven dependencies in the pom.xml file
- I haven't made it so you can run on Terminal, but you can still Run in on the Test Files. just go to Java Class that has 'Tests' behind it and run it from there

Cheers! and Have fun!
